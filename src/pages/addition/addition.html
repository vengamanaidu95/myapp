<p>The sum of values is called addition. To know the total values, one need to add two or three different values.

For example when you have 10 +5, you just regroup the numbers according to the place value of the number. If the number is in the ten’s place, then place the second number’s ten’s value under that. Similarly, do that for hundreds, thousands value. 
Now start adding the terms from extreme right and carry over the extra digit to the next column. 
Suppose you have to add. The addition formula is mentioned below.
